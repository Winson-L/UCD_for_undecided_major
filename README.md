# UCD_for_undecided_major
This is for the students in UCD who still has an undecided major after the first year.

I used Python3 for this project.

The steps to use this project:
  1. Download the data from the website (UCD Catalog) -> Run the _____
  2. Choose the way to upload the course you had taken:
      a. Store as a text file and seperate with comma ","
      b. Directly insert the course when you run the program
  3. You will receive the result on as a text file in the address that you set. 
     -- Be careful on the file address since I use Windows, not Linux. 
 
Reminder:
  1. The time that you download the data will be long.
  2. The website may be change of the UCD catalog, so you may need to change it
