# UCD_for_undecided_major
This is for the students in UCD who still has an undecided major after the first year.

I used Python3 for this project.

The steps to use this project:
  1. Download the data from the website (UCD Catalog) -> Run the program "UCDAVIS_Major"
  
  2. Conver and store the data -> Run the program "Conver_data"
  
  3. Choose the way to upload the courses you had taken:
      a. Store as a text file and seperate with comma "," -> Run the program "real_square_file_input" 
      b. Directly insert the course when you run the program -> Run the program "real_square_handly_input"
  
  4. You will receive the result on as a text file in the address that you set. 
     -- Be careful on the saving file address since I used Windows, not Linux. 
 
Reminder:
  1. The time that you download the data will be long. I tested on 6/20/19, and the time was about 12 mins for the whole catalogs
  2. The website URL may be change according to the UCD catalog, so you may need to change it.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know. Thank you so much for your time, and hope this can help you in some ways.
